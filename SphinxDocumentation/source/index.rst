Welcome to PyRecords's documentation.
=====================================

Whats New:
=========

Just created this site and got it hosted on git. 

Quick Overview:
==============

PyRecords attempts to take some of the hassle out of handling custom, regular datatypes. PyRecords attempts to do the following:

* Provide general containers to store, manipulate and handle general classes of immutable and mutable data.
* Mimic the *record* datatypes of other languages.
* Provide general utilities for manipulating record containers.
